Week 1 homework

For this project, I was expected to clean up the code while keeping in mind accessibility.
The first step I took was including alt text for each image throughout the file. Once that
was complete, I organized the code in a way that would allow screenreaders to function properly and
make it appear less overwhelming. This included seprating code into MAIN and ASIDE tags as well as 
utilizing SECTION tags.

The CSS file was also in need of some cleanup. Classes with the same styles were condensed and 
and comments were added for each section.
